## Overview

StudyGroup is a web-based app that lets people in a given group easily communicate
where and when they will be out studying.

## Scenarios

#### Scenario 1:  Scott.
Scott is a student enrolled in a full-time web-development bootcamp that is an online school.  One afternoon, she decides that it would be REALLY NICE to leave her house and finish-up her schoolwork around some other people studying similar things.  Luckily, there are other students enrolled in the same school (although not her particular course) who use StudyGroup.  Scott checks-in and sees that Sally is studying right down the road, right now. She high-tails it to the cafe.

#### Scenario 2:  Mo.
Mo works full-time as a social worker but would really like to attend a web-development bootcamp.  She is working through some pre-requisites for an in-person course, but she is having a little trouble with a few concepts and could really use some help.  She isn't in school yet, so she doesn't have classmates or teachers to ask.  Luckily, she has some friends who are programmers, and they like to get together for coding sessions.  She made them all a StudyGroup, and now she can post that she will be studying on Sunday from 8am-3pm at Anna Bananna's, with the comment that she could use some help.  One of her friends checks his StudyGroup, sees that she'd like some help, and stops in.
